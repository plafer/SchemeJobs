## C code conventions
+ Functions return 0 on success and an errno value on error. The documentation
should clearly explained what errno value is to be expected and exactly what it
means in the context of the function.
      + If a function is guaranteed to succeed, it is ok to make it void.
      + Out parameters should be used to return actual data.
+ Don't typedef structs.
